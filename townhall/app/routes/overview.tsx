            Literacy and reading is the foundation of student/academic success. The ability to read
and write is the gateway to communication, confidence, learning, achievement, and opportunity.
Literacy is also the main measurement for how “educated” a population is considered to be. It
also has a direct correlation to life expectancy, general health, job acquisition/employment,
socioeconomic, etc. Literacy rates in undeveloped countries are historically lower than more
developed countries. Literacy rates in America (by county) that have higher concentrations of
poverty are substantially lower than more affluent counties in the United States (and those rates
are compounded in areas where there is an intersection between race and socioeconomic
status).
